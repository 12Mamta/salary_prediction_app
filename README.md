# Employee Salary Prediction using Logistic Regression

This is a machine learning web application developed using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**. The project predicts whether a person's salary is greater than $50K per year based on certain demographic and professional features.

## Description

This project involves:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data
- Training a logistic regression model
- Saving the trained model as `model.pkl`
- Building a simple Streamlit UI to interact with the model

## How to Run the App

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries

### Step 3: Launch the Streamlit App

## Features Used for Prediction

- Age  
- Education Number  
- Hours per Week  

These features are input by the user through the Streamlit form, and the model outputs the predicted salary range.

---

## Output

The app predicts whether the personâ€™s salary is:
- `<=50K`  
- `>50K`

Based on the input features.

## Model Details

- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy  
- **Model Accuracy:** Approximately 80% (you may update this with your actual score)

## Optional Enhancements

- Add more features to improve model accuracy  
- Deploy the app to Streamlit Cloud  
- Add visualizations or charts to enhance UI
